# Milestone 6: Secure User Signup Implementation
Overview
In Milestone 6, we focused on implementing a secure backend endpoint to handle user signups. This included encrypting user passwords and securely storing complete user data in the database.

Key Objectives
Encrypt User Passwords:

Used the bcrypt library to hash user passwords during the signup process.
Ensured passwords are stored securely and not in plain text.
Store Complete User Data Securely:

Captured user details such as name, email, and hashed password.
Integrated a database to save user data while adhering to security best practices.
Enhance Security:

Incorporated password salting and hashing for added protection.
Minimized the risk of exposing sensitive data by sanitizing API responses.
Implementation Summary
Password Encryption:
Used bcrypt to salt and hash user passwords.
Implemented the hashing process during the signup phase to enhance security.
Database Integration:
Configured MongoDB for storing user data.
Ensured schema validation to maintain data integrity.
Signup Flow:
User Input: Name, email, and password are provided by the user.
Password Hashing: The password is encrypted using bcrypt before being saved.
Data Storage: All details, including the hashed password, are stored in the database.
API Response: A success message is returned without exposing sensitive information.
Next Steps
Add email verification functionality for added security.
Implement JWT-based authentication for user sessions.
Enhance input validation to prevent malicious user input.
Milestone 6 has laid a strong foundation for secure user authentication and data handling. Future improvements will build on these practices to further enhance the application‚Äôs security and user experience.

milestone-7
Login Authentication System
Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a secure login authentication system. It describes the purpose, the key components, and the steps required to validate user credentials and ensure secure password handling.

Why Encrypting Passwords?
Benefits:
Protect User Data: Prevents exposure of passwords even if the database is compromised.
Privacy: Ensures that passwords are not stored in plain text.
Compliance: Satisfies security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
Prevents Password Theft: Hashed passwords are computationally difficult to reverse, enhancing security.
How Login Authentication Works üîë
1. User Enters Credentials:
The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.
2. Fetch User Data from Database:
The backend retrieves the user record matching the provided email/username.
If no matching record exists, the system returns an error: "User does not exist."
3. Compare Encrypted Passwords:
The user-provided password is hashed using the same hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
The hashed input is compared with the stored hashed password.
If they match, the user is authenticated; otherwise, an error is returned.
Steps for Implementation (Milestone 7) üìù
1. Create Login Endpoint:
Accept user credentials (email/username and password).
Validate the input to ensure that all required fields are provided.
2. Retrieve User Data:
Query the database for a user record matching the provided email/username.
If the user does not exist, return an error response.
3. Validate Password:
Use bcrypt to hash the entered password.
Compare the resulting hash with the stored hashed password.
If they match, authenticate the user. Otherwise, return an error response.
Milestone-8
Card Component and Homepage Layout with Normal CSS
Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a reusable Card Component to showcase products and display them on a Homepage using normal CSS. It focuses on building a clean, visually appealing, and responsive layout without relying on CSS frameworks.

Features
1. Card Component
Displays individual product details such as:
Product name
Product image
Product price
Designed as a reusable component.
Styled using normal CSS for simplicity and flexibility.
2. Homepage Layout
Organizes multiple product cards in a grid layout.
Fully responsive design using CSS Grid.
Clean and structured presentation for better user experience.
Milestone 9: Product Form Creation
Objective
The goal of this milestone is to create a user-friendly product form that allows users to input all necessary product details and upload multiple images. The data will eventually be saved to a database and displayed on the product home page created in a previous milestone.

Why Create a Product Form?
This lesson is focused on understanding how to build forms in React for collecting and handling user input.

Purpose: To create a system where product details can be submitted by users or admins.
Outcome: Details collected through the form will be stored in a database and later displayed on the product page.
Additional Features: You can enhance the form by:
Adding admin access for product uploads.
Associating products with specific shop profiles.
Features of the Product Form
Input Fields:

Product Name
Product Description
Price
Stock Quantity
File Upload:

Multiple images can be uploaded for a product.
Image previews are displayed before submission.
Validation:

Required fields must be filled out before submission.
Backend Integration:

Data is sent to the backend using a POST request.
Steps to Create the Product Form
1. React Component Setup
Create a new React component named ProductForm.jsx.
Use state to manage input data.
Handle form submission and file input events.
2. Styling
Add normal CSS for styling the form.
Create a separate ProductForm.css file for styles.
3. Image Previews
Generate preview URLs for images using URL.createObjectURL().
4. Backend Communication
Prepare a FormData object to send data to the backend.
Milestone 11 - Dynamic Product Display
Description
In Milestone 11, the goal was to create a dynamic homepage that displays all the products saved in MongoDB. This involved setting up an API endpoint to fetch the product data and display it on the frontend using a ProductCard component. The project highlights the interaction between the backend and frontend to render dynamic data on the website.

Steps Taken
Backend (Node.js & Express)
Set up an endpoint (/api/products) to fetch all product data from MongoDB. Used Product.find() to query all products from the database. Responded with the data in JSON format. Frontend (React) Created a function to fetch product data from the API and display it dynamically.

Used useEffect to call the backend API when the component loads. Stored the fetched product data in a state variable (products). Mapped over the products and passed them to the ProductCard component to display each product. ProductCard Component:

Designed a reusable ProductCard component to display individual product details such as name, description, image, and price.

Milestone 12 - My Products Page
In Milestone 12, we implemented a "My Products" page where users can see the products they‚Äôve added to the system. The products are fetched from the backend by filtering them based on the user‚Äôs email.

Backend Changes:
A new endpoint /api/my-products was created to filter and fetch products by the authenticated user's email.
Frontend Changes:
A new React component, MyProductsPage, was created to fetch and display the products using the /api/my-products endpoint.
Key Technologies:
Node.js, Express, MongoDB
React, JavaScript
Authentication (JWT)
Milestone 13 - Edit Product Functionality
In Milestone 13, I added the ability to edit products directly from the product card. By clicking the "Edit" button, the user is taken to a form that auto-fills with the existing product data. The user can update the product information and save the changes.

Backend Changes:
A new PUT endpoint (/api/products/:id) was created to update product data in the database.
Frontend Changes:
Added an Edit button to the ProductCard component.
Created a new page (EditProductPage) where the product details are auto-filled in a form and can be updated.
