### Password Encryption:
- Used `bcrypt` to salt and hash user passwords.
- Implemented the hashing process during the signup phase to enhance security.

### Database Integration:
- Configured MongoDB for storing user data.
- Ensured schema validation to maintain data integrity.

### Signup Flow:
1. **User Input:** Name, email, and password are provided by the user.
2. **Password Hashing:** The password is encrypted using `bcrypt` before being saved.
3. **Data Storage:** All details, including the hashed password, are stored in the database.
4. **API Response:** A success message is returned without exposing sensitive information.

## milestone-7

# Login Authentication System

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a secure login authentication system. It describes the purpose, the key components, and the steps required to validate user credentials and ensure secure password handling.

---

## Why Encrypting Passwords?
### Benefits:
1. **Protect User Data:** Prevents exposure of passwords even if the database is compromised.
2. **Privacy:** Ensures that passwords are not stored in plain text.
3. **Compliance:** Satisfies security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
4. **Prevents Password Theft:** Hashed passwords are computationally difficult to reverse, enhancing security.

---

## How Login Authentication Works üîë

### 1. **User Enters Credentials:**
   - The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.

### 2. **Fetch User Data from Database:**
   - The backend retrieves the user record matching the provided email/username.
   - If no matching record exists, the system returns an error: _"User does not exist."_

### 3. **Compare Encrypted Passwords:**
   - The user-provided password is hashed using the same hashing algorithm (e.g., **bcrypt**).
   - The hashed input is compared with the stored hashed password.
   - If they match, the user is authenticated; otherwise, an error is returned.

---

## Steps for Implementation (Milestone 7) üìù

### 1. **Create Login Endpoint:**
   - Accept user credentials (email/username and password).
   - Validate the input to ensure that all required fields are provided.

### 2. **Retrieve User Data:**
   - Query the database for a user record matching the provided email/username.
   - If the user does not exist, return an error response.

### 3. **Validate Password:**
   - Use **bcrypt** to hash the entered password.
   - Compare the resulting hash with the stored hashed password.
   - If they match, authenticate the user. Otherwise, return an error response.

### **Milestone 11 - Dynamic Product Display**


### **Description**
In Milestone 11, the goal was to create a dynamic homepage that displays all the products saved in MongoDB. This involved setting up an API endpoint to fetch the product data and display it on the frontend using a ProductCard component. The project highlights the interaction between the backend and frontend to render dynamic data on the website.




### **Steps Taken**


### Backend (Node.js & Express)

Set up an endpoint (/api/products) to fetch all product data from MongoDB.
Used Product.find() to query all products from the database.
Responded with the data in JSON format.
Frontend (React)
Created a function to fetch product data from the API and display it dynamically.

Used useEffect to call the backend API when the component loads.
Stored the fetched product data in a state variable (products).
Mapped over the products and passed them to the ProductCard component to display each product.
ProductCard Component:

Designed a reusable ProductCard component to display individual product details such as name, description, image, and price.


## Milestone 12 - My Products Page

In Milestone 12, we implemented a "My Products" page where users can see the products they‚Äôve added to the system. The products are fetched from the backend by filtering them based on the user‚Äôs email.

### Backend Changes:
- A new endpoint `/api/my-products` was created to filter and fetch products by the authenticated user's email.

### Frontend Changes:
- A new React component, `MyProductsPage`, was created to fetch and display the products using the `/api/my-products` endpoint.

### Key Technologies:
- Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- React, JavaScript
- Authentication (JWT)

## Milestone 13 - Edit Product Functionality

In Milestone 13, I added the ability to edit products directly from the product card. By clicking the "Edit" button, the user is taken to a form that auto-fills with the existing product data. The user can update the product information and save the changes.

### Backend Changes:
- A new **PUT** endpoint (`/api/products/:id`) was created to update product data in the database.

### Frontend Changes:
- Added an **Edit** button to the `ProductCard` component.
- Created a new page (`EditProductPage`) where the product details are auto-filled in a form and can be updated.



### Milestone 14 - Delete Product Functionality

## In Milestone 14, we focus on implementing the ability to delete products from the e-commerce app. This involves both frontend and backend integration, with the backend providing an endpoint to delete the product and the frontend allowing users to delete products directly from the UI.

### **Features**



### 1. Backend (Node.js & Express):


Created a DELETE API endpoint (/api/products/:id) that handles product deletion by its ID.
When a delete request is made, the server will:
Search for the product by ID.
Delete the product from the MongoDB database.
Return a success or failure message based on the operation result.



### 2. Frontend (React):


## **Product Card:**


Added a Delete button to each product card displayed on the homepage.
When clicked, the button triggers an API call to delete the product from the database using the product ID.
Dynamic UI Update:
After the product is deleted, the UI will automatically update, removing the product from the list without needing to refresh the page.



### Tech Stack
